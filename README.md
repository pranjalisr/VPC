AWS vpc for application and automate VPC creation using terraform

AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) suitable for hosting an application, and then provide Terraform code to automate the VPC creation.

VPC Design Overview:

1. VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16
2. Two public subnets in different Availability Zones
3. Two private subnets in different Availability Zones
4. An Internet Gateway for the public subnets
5. A NAT Gateway in one of the public subnets for outbound internet access from private subnets
6. Route tables for public and private subnets
7. Security groups for different tiers of the application (e.g., web, app, database)

To use this Terraform code:

1. Install Terraform on your local machine.
2. Set up your AWS credentials (e.g., using AWS CLI or environment variables).
3. Create a new directory for your Terraform project and save the above code in a file named 'main.tf'.
4. Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following commands:

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

When prompted, type "yes" to confirm the creation of the resources.

This setup provides a solid foundation for hosting a multi-tier application in AWS. The public subnets can be used for load balancers or public-facing instances, while the private subnets can host your application servers and databases.

Remember to destroy the resources when you're done to avoid unnecessary charges:
terraform destroy


Disclaimer: AWS Credentials

This project does not include or reference any AWS credentials in the codebase, configuration files, or environment variables. This is an intentional decision to avoid accidental exposure of sensitive information and to prevent any unintended charges related to AWS services such as S3 bucket usage or other billable resources.

Key Points:

No Hardcoded Credentials: At no point are AWS Access Keys or Secret Keys included in the source code.

No AWS Resources Created: The project does not make any calls to AWS APIs or attempt to create resources such as S3 buckets, EC2 instances, or any other AWS service.

Environment Variables Not Configured: Ensure that no environment-specific AWS credentials are set or used while running this project.

Recommendations:

If you intend to integrate this project with AWS services, please use environment variables or a credentials manager to securely provide AWS credentials.

Consider using the AWS SDK with temporary security tokens, IAM roles, or a secure secret management tool.

By omitting AWS credentials from this project, I aim to maintain secure coding practices and avoid unnecessary charges or misuse of resources.
